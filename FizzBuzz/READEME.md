Write a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 with the following exceptions:

It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.

It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.

When it's done, improve it so that the program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 and by 5.

From 1 to 100 check every number if if is divisible by 3 and if so, show on the screen "Fizz" and if is fivisible by 3 and 5 then it should show on the screen "Buzz. When is divizible
