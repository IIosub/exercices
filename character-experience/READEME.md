Adding character experience

Improve our example RPG program to add an experience property named xp to the character. Its initial value is 0. Experience must appear in character description.

// TODO: create the character object here

// Aurora is harmed by an arrow
aurora.health -= 20;

// Aurora equips a strength necklace
aurora.strength += 10;

// Aurora learn a new skill
aurora.xp += 15;

console.log(aurora.describe());
Execution result
