Write a program that asks the user for a number, then shows the multiplication table for this number.

When you are done, improve the program so it only accepts numbers between 2 and 9 (use the previous exercise as a blueprint).

- Ask the user for a number number and store it. The number should be multiplied like this 1*3 2*3 3\*3.
- If twe want to accepst numbers between 2 and 9 then use a condition, if number is greater or equal than 2 and number is less or equal than 9 then do the multiplication.
